# Striver's A-Z DSA Sheet Solutions

Striver's A-Z DSA sheet is a comprehensive collection of problems covering essential topics in data structures and algorithms, from basics to advanced levels. This project organizes solutions by topic and lecture, allowing for easy navigation and comparison across languages.

## Languages Used
![C++](https://img.shields.io/badge/C%2B%2B-00599C?style=plastic&logo=c%2B%2B&logoColor=white) ![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-4CAF50?style=plastic&logo=python&logoColor=white) ![JavaScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/JavaScript-F7DF1E?style=plastic&logo=javascript&logoColor=black) ![Kotlin](https://img.shields.io/badge/Kotlin-7F52FF?style=plastic&logo=kotlin&logoColor=white)

> why these languages?
> bcoz it's my choice :D  | kidding, its just my personal tech stack :
> - C++ for DSA and low level understanding 👈🏻(PRIMARY)
> - Python for backend as it's versatile and AI gimmick
> - JavaScript there's no any option
> - Kotlin, experimentation
> - ... *may add more*

```

- Each language folder mirrors the same structure, with subfolders named by topic number and lecture.
- Files are named descriptively based on the problem or concept (e.g., `io.cpp` for input/output basics).
- The structure allows for easy comparison of solutions across languages for the same problem.

## How to Use ?

#### Running C++ code
1. Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed (e.g., g++).
2. Navigate to the desired file: `cd cpp/1. basics/lecture 1/`
3. Compile and run: `g++ io.cpp -o io && ./io`

#### Running JavaScript code
1. Ensure Node.js is installed.
2. Navigate to the desired file: `cd javascript/1. basics/lecture 1/`
3. Run: `node io.js`

#### Running Python code
1. Ensure Python is installed (preferably Python 3.x).
2. Navigate to the desired file: `cd python/1. basics/lecture 1/`
3. Run: `python io.py` or `python3 io.py`

#### Running Kotlin code
1.
